	Basel Committee says operational risk is:
	" the risk of direct and indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes
	people and systems or from external events."

	-it includes legal risk.
	-but leaves out reputational and strategic risk because they are difficult to measure.

	protect against operational risk losses with a capital buffer.
	1. basic indicator approach.
	2. standardized approach.
	3. advanced measurement approach. 

	Basic indicator approach, capital buffer
	- keep 15% of gross income (average over the past three years)
	- ex. year 1, 150 million. year 2, 200 million. year 3, 300 million.
		total 650 million.
		.15 * 650/3 = 32.5 million capital buffer.

	Standardized approach, capital buffer, weighted risks
	- bank activities are classified into eight distinct business lines.
	- average gross income from each business line is multiplied by the lines Beta factor?
	- capital results from each are summed up.
	(requirements, control mechanisms)
	- regular reports, risk identification, well documented, independent reviews.

	Advanced Measurement Approach, capital buffer, weighted risks, VAR
	- For each business line, 7 catagories of operational risk:
		1. Internal fraud
		2. External fraud
		3. Clients products and business practices
		4. Employment practices and work safety
		5. Damage to physical assets
		6. Business Disruption and system failures
		7. Execution, delivery and process management.
	- Banks estimate one year VAR for each combination.

	Loss frequency and Loss severity
	"number of losses defined over a specified time period."
	- loss frequency is measured with poisson distribution because interger number of events.
	- loss severity is the size of the loss, log normal distribution and one fat tail, 
	  monte carlo used to simulate loss.
	
	Scenario Analysis
	- Aims to establish how a firm would do under a range of different scenarios. Stress testing?
	- Studies the impact of low frequnecy high severity losses.

	Allocation of operational risk capital
	- identify Key Risk Inddicators (KRI)
	- evaluate return on capital employed (ROCE) asses a units performance relative to others.
	- reduce capital needs with better risk management.
	
	Scorecards and surveying risk indicators
	- managers are assed on their ability to apprehend/negate risk.
	- score them, asses exposure to risk.	

	POWER LAW
	rule of thumb for measurement of operational risk.
	
	P(x > v) = KV**-a
	a = power law parameter
	V = value at risk
	K = scale coefficient

	ex. .05 = K(50)**-0.7  <- 5% the prob exceed 50 million
	then K = 0.7731

	ex. what is the prob the loss exceeds 20 million?

	p = 0.7731(20)**-0.7 = 9.95%
