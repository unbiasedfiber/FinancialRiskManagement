	Franco Modigilani Merton Miller, how to value a firm? 

	A model.

	- focus attention on quality of the firms asset and cost of capital
	- capital markets are efficient, no opportunities for riskless profits
	- the value of the firm cannot be changed by changing transactions
	- risk management is irrelevant in determining the value of business.

	but,

	relax the assumptions and you get bid/ask spreads, default, transaction cost, risk etc.
	a counter to real risks:

	- eliminate unsystematic risk with a diverse portfolio.

	Reasons for risk management
	- the efficient market hypothesis does not reflect reality, again, transaction costs, taxes, default, bid/ask
	- systematic risk, financial distress and bankruptcy.
	- Agency risk, "agents" do not act in the best interest of the principal

	Risk managment is vital for success!

	- tax incentives
	- Volatile earnings induce higher taxation than stable earnings.
	- Hedging increases the debt capacity of firms, increases interest tax deductions.
	- derivatives for tax avoidance.

	Accepting some form of risk, hedging other risks and managing hedging costs constitute underlying risk management.

	Risk management in practice
	
	-clear decisions, objectives goals
	- risk appetite should be determined by the board of directors
	- types of risks, limits for losses with confidence intervals
	- establish risk tolerance level
	- can be used to screen projects
	- est objectives so that everyone is taken care of, shareholders, creditors
	- establish time horizons
	- (hedging in general is a short term issue, tactical monitoring)
	
	Mapping of Risks
	- general policy structure pertaining to risk management set by the board of directors
	- identify risks and determine the appropriate instruments to hedge risks.

	Internal hedging
	- strategy made within firm to hedge risks, ie move manufacturing around the world to less risks places.

	External hedging
	- exchange traded market or over the counter market.
	- exchange traded intruments are standardized products with maturities and strikes set in advance, while OTC derivatives
	  are traded by investment banks etc. can e tailored to firms needs.
	- OTC is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange.
	- OTC credit risk is higher.

	Division and implementing a strategy
	- access to (good) data and statistical tools is required to frame a strategy for hedging.
	- static strategies, hedge remains until the exposure ends.
	- dynamic strategies are constantly maintained.

	Horizon
	- when to open/close positions
	- tax laws vary between countries
	- accounting, books must be perfect
