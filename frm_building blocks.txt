	Risk and its management

	What is risk?
	- Potential variability of returns around an expected return
	- we can measure risk by variability.
	- there is no return without risk.

	Risk Managers must be able to price risks.
	- determine the compensation for risk.
	- price risk, or vaiability of returns.

	RISK		- the variability that can be quantified in terms of probabilities
	UNCERTAINTY	- the variability that cannot be quantified at all.

	Types of risks
	- each type of risk requires different management.
	
	MARKET RISK
			> equity price risk
			> interest rate risk
			> currency risk
			> commodity risk 
				- trading risk (general market, specific risk)
				- gap risk	
	Equity price risk
	- volatility in the stock prices
	- reduction of value of a portfolio or security due to market variables
	- general market risk: risk of the economic system, diversification reduces specific risk.
	- specific market risk: specific to industry or company.

	Interest rate risk
	- market interest rates, bonds interest/price relation

	Currency risk
	- exposure to exchange rates, foreign currencies.

	Commodity price risk
	- volatility associated with the prices of commodities. deriviatives are used to hedge price fluctuations

	CREDIT RISK

			> downgrade risk
			> bankruptcy risk
			> portfolio concentration risk

	Bankruptcy risk
	- risk associated with a borrowers inability to clear his debt resulting in takeover of collateralized assets

	Downgrade risk
	- decline in credit rating, drop in creditworthiness.

	issues: creditworthiness of the obligor, high risk, high interest. 
	concentration risk, the extent of diversification of asset base should be a concern.

	LIQUIDITY RISK
	
			> funding liquidity risk
			> trading liquidity risk

	liquidity risk is the risk that a firm may be unable to meet short term financial needs.
	
	Liquidity risk
	- the risk that a firm is unable to settle its obligations immediately when they are due.
	
	Trading liquidty risk
	- the risk associated with the inability to execute transactions at the prevailing market price.


	OPERATIONAL RISK
			
			> AML risk
			> Cyber risk
			> Model risk
	
	risk that arise due to operational weaknesses like management failure, faulty controls, inadequate systems etc
	operational weakness/event risk.

	Anti Money Laundering (AML) risk
	- prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income.
	Cyber risk
	- data breach, cyber attack
	Model risk
	- risk that a model doesn't reflect reality. financial model used to measure quantitative information fails
	  or performs inadequately.

	BUSINESS STRATEGIC and REPUTATIONAL RISK

			> business risk
			> strategic risk
			> reputational risk
	
	investments into assets and associated risk
	
	Business risk
	- uncertainties in demand, cost of production and the cost of delivery of products.

	Strategic risk
	- risk of significant investments where the uncertainty is high

	Reputation risk
	- similar to creditworthiness, follow ethics.

	Interactions of risk types

	Risks can flow from one type to another
		ie. Credit risk -> Liquidity risk -> Market risk
	*flow can occur rapidly.


	++++++++

	1. Identify
		name, catagorize, understand
	2. Analyze
		rank, score, measure, quant
	3. Assess
		effects, repercussions
	4. Manage	
		avoid, retain, mitigate, transfer

	Methods of management
		- Avoid: close down the business unit, change the business strategy.
		- Retain or keep risk: Accept the riskiness of a project
		- Mitigation: decrease exposure, frequency or severity of the risk
		- Transfer risk: insurance, derivatives

	learn to calculate Expected loss, unexpected loss, VaR

	Expected loss (EL) $
	probability of default (PD) %
	loss given default (LGD) $
	exposure at default (EAD) $
	
	EL = EAD*LGD*PD

	Unexpected loss
	- variation in the expected loss, the error around EL
	- the average total loss over and above the expected loss

	VaR (value at risk)
	- statistical measure that defines a particular level of loss in terms of its chances of occurance
	  confidence level of the analysis
	- used for extreme losses with very low probabilities.

	Risk Aggregation
	Risk managers should be able to identify riskiest businesses and determine the aggregate risks of a firm
	
	Market risks are easily quantified and controlled by comparing the notional amount in each asset held
	- this is impractical since different industries have different volatility

	Derivative traders developed risk measures, the greeks
	- they are limited at the enterprise level

	VaR
	- doesn't give the magnitude of the loss

	understanding how risks are aggregated and the drawbacks and advantages that come with it is an essential
	risk management building block.
