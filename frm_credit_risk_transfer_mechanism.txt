	- traditionally banks take short-term deposits and pool them together to provide long-term loans
	- However, these loans introduce credit risk, borrower may default
	- there are several ways to approach this type of risk exposure.
	- Accept, Avoid, Reduce, Transfer

	Here we will examine risk transfer only

	Credit Derivitives are financial instruments that transfer credit risk from one party to another.
	- credit derivatives transfer risk without transfering the underlying
	- credit derivatives are over the counter instruments, non-standardized, trading not bound by SEC
	- credit derivatives include: swaptions, CDOs, total return swaps, credit default swaps

	CDS Credit default swaps (compensation for default of borrower, insurance on coupon payments)

	- if the issuer fails to pay the coupon, swap dealer must pay.
	- CDSs can serves as a shock absorber during a corporate crisis.
	- CDS contracts ultimately result in more liquidity
	- pricing of CDSs reflect prevailing financial health of the debtor
	- low premium less risk.
	- however speculators may inflate the prices of CDSs, subject to manipulation.

	CDO collateralized debt obligations

	- ie. bank loans, credit default swaps, mortgage backed securities, groups of bonds.	
	- products made by banks to 'offload' risk
	- securities that are packages of risky instruments, loans.
	- diversified investments, pools of securities.
	- a Special Purpose Vehicle, products sold to investors

	- senior tranche holders paid first,
	- mezzazine paid then equity tranche.
	
	- combine investments mitigate risk.
	- financial institution can be less diligent in credit risk analysis
	
	Total return swap
	
	- one party pays a fixed rate, counterparty pays a variable, floating rate.
	- combination of credit and market risk, winning party gets the capital gains.
	- based on notional principle.
	- includes interest rate risk and credit (counterparty)risk. however the most preferred vehicle
	
	Swaption
	
	- work just like call/put on swaps.

	Marking-to-market, settlement of gains and losses at the end of the day.
	
	- avoids accumulation of large losses
	- termination, define trigger clauses of the contract, how to get out of the contract.

	Securitization
	- transfer ownership of assets from original owners to special purpose vehicles
	- more legal claim, match risk and maturity needs.
	- there are two main parties in securitization: originator (seller of collateral) owns the pool of assets
	  sells them to the issuer. Special Purpose Vehicle, creates a security backed by assets acquired and sells them to investors
	
	insurance tools, basically.
